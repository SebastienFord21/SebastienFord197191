p5.js Open Processing 1: Response to Te Aro and Waitangi
I decided to include my week 4 code, Te Aro and Waitangi. It is very simple, as it just includes basic shapes and fills.
I chose this because it was the first piece of code I wrote with real meaning behind it, as I did it as a response to my Wananga visit.
I wrote it on my laptop at Wellington Harbour, to represent the Waitangi river flowing into the Te Aro Harbour. I would like to continue
to write code and make art with meaning behind it, and this was my first step. 

p5.js Open Processing 2: Rotating Lines
I included my week 6 code, Rotating Lines. This code comprises of a for loop that draws lines of 6 different colours rotating out from the centre, 
using the rotate function. It then draws a circle with the colour of the background, then a rectangle with a stroke of the background in the centre, 
which makes it look like only 1 rectangle is being drawn. I chose this because I really like how it turned out- The concentric rings of lines surrounding the 
rotating rectangle draws the eye in. It also incorperates many of the skills we learned in the previous week, and is a culmination of everything 
I learned for p5.js. To develop this further, I would like to find a way to make the code scale better in different sized screens, as it draws lines between
specified points- perhaps using screen percentages might work. 

p5.js Open Processing 3: Translate/Rotate Triangles
I used my week 6 code, Translate/Rotate Triangles. This code creates a flower-like shape, by drawing triangles from the centre of the screen rotating 360 degrees. 
It does this using an if function with a for loop within it. inside the for loop it randomizes the size and colour of the triangles, rotates them 15 degrees from the 
previous one, then draws them. I chose this one because I found it interesting how many variantions of the flower you can get by repeatedly running the code. It is also highly
variable, as you can easily change clearly labled variables to get an even greater variety of flowers. To develop this variability more, I would like to have the variables able to 
be changed at the top of the page, to make it even easier to change.
