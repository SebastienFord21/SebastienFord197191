p5.js Open Processing 1: Response to Te Aro and Waitangi

I decided to include my week 4 code, Te Aro and Waitangi. It is very simple, as it just includes basic shapes and fills.
I chose this because it was the first piece of code I wrote with real meaning behind it, as I did it as a response to my Wananga visit.
I wrote it on my laptop at Wellington Harbour, to represent the Waitangi river flowing into Te Aro Harbour. I would like to continue
to write code and make art with meaning behind it, and this was my first step. 

p5.js Open Processing 2: Rotating Lines

I included my week 6 code, Rotating Lines. This code comprises of a for loop that draws lines of 6 different colours rotating out from the centre, 
using the rotate function. It then draws a circle with the colour of the background, then a rectangle with a stroke of the background in the centre, 
which makes it look like only 1 rectangle is being drawn. I chose this because I really like how it turned out- The concentric rings of lines surrounding the 
rotating rectangle draws the eye in. It also incorperates many of the skills we learned in the previous week, and is a culmination of everything 
I learned for p5.js. To develop this further, I would like to find a way to make the code scale better in different sized screens, as it draws lines between
specified points- perhaps using screen percentages might work. 

p5.js Open Processing 3: Translate/Rotate Triangles

I used my week 6 code, Translate/Rotate Triangles. This code creates a flower-like shape, by drawing triangles from the centre of the screen rotating 360 degrees. 
It does this using an if function with a for loop within it. inside the for loop it randomizes the size and colour of the triangles, rotates them 15 degrees from the 
previous one, then draws them. I chose this one because I found it interesting how many variantions of the flower you can get by repeatedly running the code. It is also highly
variable, as you can easily change clearly labled variables to get an even greater variety of flowers. To develop this variability more, I would like to have the variables able to 
be changed at the top of the page, to make it even easier to change. 

Touch Designer 1: Sebastien Ford 197191 Week 9_3

I chose my week 9, output 3 code. This uses the noise, blur, edge, displace and feedback tops, in addition to the standard comp, level, transform tops. I chose this one because it uses a variety
of tops I didn't fully utilize on my other Touch Designer outputs. The changing lines and colours is mesmerising and looks great on the black background. I would like to explore the noise, displace
and feedback tops more, as I think they have great applications if I utilized them with some of my other code. 

Touch Designer 2: Sebastien Ford 197191 Week 11_1.5

I chose my week 11, output 1 code. This is probably the most complex network I made in Touch Designer and is highly variable, as I used a switch to cycle between 4 different shapes. The code includes 
a variety of different sops, such as sphere, circle and copy. The shapes are wireframed then combined together, then fed into a switch. The switch moves to a geo setup to visualize them. Colour is then applied 
using a line mat fed into the render. I then run the render through multiple transforms, mirrors, tiles bloom tops to create interesting patterns. One of the shapes feeding into the switch uses audio reactivity I made to 
change the radius of the sphere in time to the music. I chose this code because it is complex and I like how highly variable it is, with multiple outputs if I use the switch. To enhance this, I would like to 
comment the code so it is easier to know what variables to change to get the desired output. 

Touch Designer 3: Sebastien Ford 197191 Week 11_3.1

I chose my week 11, output 3 code. While not nearly as complex as the previous code, I chose this simply because I like how it looks, and It is a continuation of my understanding of sops feeding into a geo network. I used
the tupe sop this time and combine it with a circle, both wireframed. I use absTime.seconds to rotate the shape, and use 2 different colours for the lines in the line mat to create variation, and I feed it into a bloom top.
This creates the effect of almost sound waves as the shape spins, with a glowing centre. I would like to explore different camera angles and movement in the camera comp, as I think it would enhance the movement and 3d nature of the shape.
